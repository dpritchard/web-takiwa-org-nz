The old takiwa.org.nz site is gone, but the project continues.

Perhaps the most useful page on the old site was [the reports][rpts], which are [still available here][rpts].

Work on this project continues internally within the Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Mahinga Kai Monitoring team.

Please contact Nigel Scott from Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu for more information.
